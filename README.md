## Programming Style Guidelines
+ Always label plots
+ Take care to choose the type of plot to highlight the most relevant information

## Common Pitfalls
+ Forgetting that subplot numbers the plots rowwise rather than columnwise
+ Not realizing that the subplot function just creates a matrix within the Figure Window. Each part of this matrix must then be filled with a plot, using any type of plot function
+ Closing a Figure Window prematurelyâ€”the properties can only be set if the Figure Window is still open!
